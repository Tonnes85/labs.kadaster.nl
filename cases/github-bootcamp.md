## Musicals (Cathelijne)
My favourite movie en series genre is musical. I grew up with a lot of music in my life. I am the type of person that could 
listen to music all day, every day. This has effected my choice in movies that I like to watch. The fact that there is a 
possibility to combine music and movies makes me very happy. 

Here is a list of my recommendations :)

* Grease
* Singing in the Rain
* Dirty Dancing
* Saturday Night Fever
* Purple Rain
* West Side Story
* Chicago
* The Wiz
* Sister Act 1 & 2
